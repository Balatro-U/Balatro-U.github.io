            Balatro is a roguelike deckbuilder game known for its unique poker-inspired mechanics. This project aims to bring Balatro to the Wii U platform, making it accessible to a new audience of players.

        <p>
            Our goal is to faithfully recreate the Balatro experience on Wii U, leveraging the console's features and controls. The project is open-source, and we encourage developers and enthusiasts to join us in improving compatibility, performance, and gameplay.
